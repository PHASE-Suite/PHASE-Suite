## üìñ Introduction

Welcome to the **PHASE Suite**!

Accurate detection of DNA mutations is essential in fields like genetic toxicology, where it's used to assess the genotoxicity of chemicals and evaluate cancer risk. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) has transformed genetic research, its utility is limited by an inherent error rate of 0.1% to 1% per base. This background noise often exceeds the true mutation rate‚Äîwhich can be as low as 1 in 100 million (1√ó10‚Åª‚Å∏)‚Äîmaking it difficult to detect rare but biologically important mutations.

Error-corrected NGS (ecNGS) technologies have emerged to overcome this limitation. Methods such as **PacBio HiFi sequencing** improve accuracy by redundantly sequencing both DNA strands, dramatically reducing sequencing errors and enabling the reliable detection of ultra-rare mutations.

**PHASE** is a lightweight and user-friendly bioinformatic toolkit for analyzing PacBio HiFi BAM files to detect somatic mutations. By computationally pairing the forward and reverse strands of individual DNA molecules, it filters out random sequencing errors, enabling accurate identification of true low-frequency mutations.

The suite currently includes:

**PHASE Pipeline** ([`phase-script.sh`](phase-script.sh)): A robust bash script that automates the entire workflow, from raw PacBio BAM files to a final, high-confidence list of somatic mutations.

**Visualization Script** (Coming Soon): A Python tool for generating publication-quality plots of mutational signatures from the pipeline's output.

## ‚ú® Features

* **High-Fidelity Mutation Calling**: Achieves high sensitivity and precision by requiring that a mutation be present on both the forward and reverse strands of a single DNA molecule.
* **Automated Workflow**: A single script orchestrates a multi-step process involving alignment, filtering, strand-pairing, and variant calling (**mismatches**).
* **Parallel Processing**: Built with GNU Parallel to efficiently process multiple samples across many CPU cores, significantly reducing runtime.
* **Comprehensive Filtering**: Implements several layers of filtering based on **mapping quality**, **strand agreement**, and the removal of **non-unique mutation events** to ensure high-confidence results.
* **Clear Outputs**: Generates well-structured output files, including a final tab-separated file of mutations ready for downstream analysis.
* **(Coming Soon) Mutational Signature Analysis**: The accompanying Python script will allow for easy visualization of the mutational landscape (e.g. SBS signatures).

## üöÄ Installation & Quick Start

The recommended way to install PHASE Suite and its dependencies is by using the provided Conda environment file.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/PHASE-Suite/PHASE-Suite.git](https://github.com/PHASE-Suite/PHASE-Suite.git)
cd PHASE-Suite
```

**2. Create and Activate the Conda Environment**

This command uses the `environment.yml` file to automatically install all required software.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate phase_suite_env
```

**3. Configure Pipeline Paths**

Before running, you must open `phase-script.sh` in a text editor and provide the correct paths for your reference genome and the `sam2tsv.jar` file.
```bash
# Open phase-script.sh and edit these lines near the top:
ref_fa="/path/to/your/reference_genome.fa"
sam2tsv_jar="/path/to/your/jvarkit/sam2tsv.jar"
```

**4. Run the Pipeline**

Place your input BAM files in the `original-bams/` directory and execute the script:
```bash
bash phase-script.sh
```
